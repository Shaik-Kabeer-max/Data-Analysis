# Data-Analysis
This is my first data analysis project using a Netflix movie dataset. I cleaned and transformed the data using Pandas and visualized key insights with Seaborn and Matplotlib. The project includes genre analysis, vote distribution, movie release trends, and title word frequencyâ€”all summarized in a simple static dashboard.
