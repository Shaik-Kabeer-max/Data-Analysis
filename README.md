# Netflix Movie Dataset Analysis

This is my first data analysis project where I explored a Netflix movie dataset using Python. The goal was to clean the data, analyze trends, and visualize insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Key Objectives:
- Analyze the most frequent movie genres
- Understand vote average distribution (converted into categories)
- Explore release year trends and volume
- Identify top genres by popularity
- Find common words used in movie titles

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Preprocessing Steps:
- Converted release dates to datetime and extracted the year
- Handled missing and duplicate data
- Transformed numerical vote averages into categories
- Split and exploded multi-genre entries
- Dropped unnecessary columns

## Visualizations:
The static dashboard includes:
- Genre frequency count
- Vote average distribution
- Movies released per year
- Top 10 genres by average popularity
- Top 10 most common words in movie titles

## Project Status:
âœ… Completed  
This was a great learning experience for working with real-world datasets and visualizing insights. Feedback is welcome!
